Ideas for future improvements

- Update the block list so that domains aren't visible, but replaced with one of these4 privacy categories (health, legal, finance, other)
- Write a script that will automate calling an LLM to run the prompt analyze_domains_and_block.md and update the blocklist. Make it use .prmpt.md format.
- Different kinds of analysis
- Can Google or Apple's GPRS export format tell us about activity on the phone? That would be cool!
- Different types of visualizations.
- Add async favicon fetching for better performance
- More feedback on progress with fetch-favicons.sh
- Document architectural decisions
